# Astronomy Picture of the Day

This application utilizes [NASA's APOD API](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api) to display today's Astronomy Picture. This application was created as a way for me to become familiar with Typescript in React, Sass, and the [particles.js](https://particles.js.org/) library. This project was inspired by this [tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/make-a-stellar-react-nasa-app-in-10-minutes)
